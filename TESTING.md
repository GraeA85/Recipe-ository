# Peer Review

I asked family members to test the website, ensuring they accessed each function and page of the website, thoroughly testing every available option.

- Feedback included:
    - Main font used on the index page did not stand out sufficiently and was sometimes difficult to read. I changed the font to a more readable font for some parts of the website. I was also told the jumbotron text needed splitting up, therefore I added a hr.
